Ketty gives Eve a task to generate a report containing **three columns: Name, Grade and Mark**. 

Ketty doesn't want the NAMES of those students who received a grade lower than 8. The report must be in descending order by grade -- i.e. higher grades are entered first. If there is more than one student with the same grade (8-10) assigned to them, order those particular students by their name alphabetically. 

Finally, if the grade is lower than 8, use "NULL" as their name and list them by their grades in descending order. If there is more than one student with the same grade (1-7) assigned to them, order those particular students by their marks in ascending order.


Write a query to help Eve.


*<풀이>*
```sql
-- RANGE JOIN (범위 조인)
-- MARKS가 특정 범위에 속하는지로 조인
SELECT (CASE
    WHEN G.GRADE >= 8 THEN S.NAME
    ELSE "NULL") AS NAME,
    S.MARKS, G.GRADE
FROM STUDENTS S
JOIN GRADE G
    ON S.MARKS BETWEEN G.MIN_MARK AND G.MAX_MARK
ORDER BY
    CASE 
        WHEN GRADE >= 8 THEN GRADE DESC
        ELSE GRADE DESC, MARKS ASC;

-- 문법 오류 + 테이블/컬럼 참조 오류 + ORDER BY 작성 방식 오류
```


* ELSE "NULL" >> 이건 문자열 "NULL" >> **ELSE NULL**로 써야 함
* G.MARKS는 존재 X >> **S.MARKS**
* ORDER BY 문법 틀림 >> DESC를 CASE 안에 넣을 수 없음


  > **ORDER BY를 여러 기준으로 나누고, CASE는 필요한 곳만**
* CASE는 **값(표현식)**만 반환해야 함 (정렬 키워드는 값을 반환하는 게 X)


*<정답>*
```SQL
SELECT CASE WHEN G.GRADE >= 8 THEN S.NAME ELSE NULL END AS NAME,
  G.GRADE, S.MARKS
FROM STUDENTS S
JOIN GRADES G
  ON S.MARKS BETWEEN G.MIN_MARK AND G.MAX_MARK
ORDER BY G.GRADE DESC,
  CASE WHEN G.GRADE >= 8 THEN S.NAME END ASC,
  CASE WHEN G.GRADE < 8 THEN S.MARKS END ASC;
```
